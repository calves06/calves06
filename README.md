### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**My name is Catherine (Catie) Alves, Ph.D.**  
*Pronouns: she/her/hers*  
I am a marine ecologist and conservation social scientist currently contracted to [NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-center) [Social Sciences Branch.](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact-directory/social-sciences-branch) This is my personal GitHub.  

My research interests focus on marine social-ecological systems, coral reef ecology, sustainable fisheries management, and stakeholder engagement. I have worked in Mexico, Belize, and the Northeast United States to combine social science with ecology to inform improved management of marine ecosystems. I value connecting academics, resource managers, and communities to achieve shared conservation objectives.
